## This is a basic template for svelte applications
I'm testing the idea of making a company template for DataCan where I currently serve as the Optimus Prime Minister of Technology.

Why not use the latest Svelte Kit / Vite stuff? 
Well I haven't tried it yet and I want to avoid confusing myself and others right off the bat.

### To use this template
Navigate to the root of your project and clone this repo into a folder called 'web'.
You could clone it elsewhere by changing 'web' to 'elsewhere' in the command above, 
but I would chose somthing more meaningful; in fact I did...
```bash
git clone https://github.com/leehayford/sv-web.git web
```

### Install the dependencies
*Note: You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*
```bash
cd web
npm install
```

### To run the development server and see if it worked
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will compile the svelte files and start the development server.

### To compile without running the development server
```bash
npm run build
```
This will compile the svelte files and allow you to server them up using some other server.
